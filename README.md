A repo for my Spring 2018 PHP & WordPress project.

This project focused on creating a custom Wordpress theme and building out a sample site to showcase it. My theme was inspired by the 1990's Gameboy Pokemon games, and used CSS Grids and Flexbox to build up a responsive Pokedex, or encyclopedia of the Pokemon. Many elements from the games menu and pokedex were translated into this theme, from the moving background, to the navigation hover effects.
